        <p class="lead mb-4">I have been faced with multiple obstacles in my educational path and have realized to not let any of them affect me, but rather use them to my advantage. My senior year in highschool we were submitting applications and like everyone else, I wanted to attend one of the Universities because I was passionate about attending. I was unfortunately faced with the reality of being rejected from all of the universities I applied to. I could have stopped here, gone to a California State University, but I knew where I wanted to go. The UCâ€™s are the universities for me and my pursuits to attend one did not stop due to receiving rejection. So, I decided not to attend any Cal States. I then enrolled in a community college because I was informed it would be more affordable and I would be able to transfer from a junior college to a University within two years. When I first enrolled, I felt ashamed and embarrassed because I was attending a junior college. Junior colleges have a negative stigma revolving around them because some individuals who attend result in dropping out or overstaying multiple years. After reevaluating that there was no shame to feel or embarrassment, I noticed everything it has given me. Attending a junior college was the best decision I could have possibly made. It has assisted me in realizing what I truly would like to become career wise. Due to the fact that money has been a recurring struggle within my family, it has definitely made life easier because no loans were needed to be taken out. It has helped me focus on transferring out in a reasonable time frame rather than having to work towards paying off student loans on top of other expenses. I have definitely grown as a person while attending a junior college and could not be more than ready for the courses to come while attending one of the University of California. 
This is just a short description of how I was able to get to where I am. I want to focus on how I got into psychology initially. It all began when I took my first intro course, I loved the idea of Psychology from the start. The ideas of why people act a certain way or the ideas behind what makes the brain act a certain way fascinates me. The course discussed different theorists and their theorists they offered to the psychology field. It was mind blowing that there was nearly a specific term for every action we as humans provoke or even every thought we might be thinking of. Psychology has a lot to offer especially in the jog aspect; how versatile and flexible of a major it is was also another reason behind why I chose to select Psychology as my major. I plan to be a Psychologist or a Therapist, mainly focusing on children. I feel that I work best with children because ever since I was a teen I always found working with children not as challenging as adults. It does get tricky with children at times but Iâ€™m willing to work with them because we as experienced adults have a large impact on children's lives on how we guide them. So I find it extremely important to provide them with the proper information and guidance to the best of my ability.
